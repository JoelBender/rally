# Rally

This web site forum software is a mashup of the core features from a variety of social web sites coupled with document sharing and task management tools.

* **public** content for users and guests
  * a _news section_ for front page news, like a blog
  * a _reference section_ for free-form content, a wiki
  * _document repository_ for white papers
* **protected** content for registered general interest users
  * a _question and answer_ section, a simplified version of [OSQA](http://www.osqa.net/) or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
* **private** content for groups and their members
  * each group gets its own private _forum_, _document repository_, _wiki_, and _task board_
  * the forum and document repository together function like [Yahoo Groups](https://groups.yahoo.com/)
  * the task board is a [Kanban Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) that acts like [Trello](https://trello.com/)
